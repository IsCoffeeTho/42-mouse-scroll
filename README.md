# 42-mouse-scroll

"Ask and ye shall receive" - Anon

A simple launch agent to set the ByHost preference for mouse scrolling to UNNATURAL ðŸ˜±

There are two components:

A script to go in ~/Library/Scripts/

A launch agent to go in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

Because launchd is very picky about permissions, I have also included an install script.

(Don't forget you might still need to chmod+x the install script)
